Hi! My name is Ivan and I am currently a PhD student at Maastricht University.

My research focuses on **time series econometrics**, **macroeconometrics**, and the use of **structured data** in econometric modeling.
I am particularly interested in matrix-valued data, statistical inference, and applications to climate data and macroeconomics.
