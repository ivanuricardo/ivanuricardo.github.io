We hereby allow separate cointegrating relations along the rows and columns of the matrix-valued time series and use information criteria to select the cointegration ranks. Through Monte Carlo simulations and a macroeconomic application, we demonstrate that our approach provides a reliable estimation of the number of cointegrating relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\nDecomposing Co-Movements in Matrix-Valued Time Series: A Pseudo-Structural Reduced Rank Approach\n\n\n\nwith Alain Hecq and Ines Wilms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nWe propose a pseudo-structural framework for analyzing contemporaneous co-movements in reduced-rank matrix autoregressive (RRMAR) models. Unlike conventional vector-autoregressive (VAR) models that would discard the matrix structure, our formulation preserves it, enabling a decomposition of co-movements into three interpretable components: row-specific, column-specific, and joint (row–column) interactions across the matrix-valued time series. Our estimator admits standard asymptotic inference and we propose a BIC-type criterion for the joint selection of the reduced ranks and the autoregressive lag order. We validate the method’s finite-sample performance in terms of estimation accuracy, coverage and rank selection in simulation experiments, including cases of rank misspecification. We illustrate the method’s practical usefulness in identifying co-movement structures in two empirical applications: U.S. state-level coincident and leading indicators, and cross-country macroeconomic indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced-Rank Matrix Autoregressions: A Medium \\(N\\) Approach\n\n\n\nwith Alain Hecq and Ines Wilms\nCFE-CM Statistics Presentation Slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nReduced-rank regressions are powerful tools used to identify co-movements within economic time series. However, this task becomes challenging when we observe matrix-valued time series, where each dimension may have a different co-movement structure. We propose reduced-rank regressions with a tensor structure for the coefficient matrix to provide new insights into co-movements within and between the dimensions of matrix-valued time series. Moreover, we relate the co-movement structures to two commonly used reduced-rank models, namely the serial correlation common feature and the index model. Two empirical applications involving U.S. states and economic indicators for the Eurozone and North American countries illustrate how our new tools identify co-movements."

    "text": "I recently came across a blog post by Frank DiTraglia on how to read econometric papers. Econometric papers are notoriously difficult to read, and even if you have been reading papers for a while, you may still be struggling to understand the content. So I just wanted to share this blog post to spread the word on how to read econometric papers. Some of my thoughts:\n\nForm a reading group. Reading papers with others can help you understand the content better. Even discussing a paper with a friend can help you understand the content better.\nStart with Empirical Example. This was mentioned in the blog post, but I think it is worth reiterating. Avoiding the theory might sound counterintuitive if you want to understand the paper, but coming back to the theory after understanding the empirical example can help you greatly understand the mathematics.\nIf you want to understand the math, start small. The authors may intend that the audience has a high level of mathematical knowledge, but you can start by understanding the basics and then build on that.\n\nThe last part of the blog post on asymptotics is particularly interesting. I have recently started trying to dive into the world of asymptotics, as I believe they are crucial for understanding econometric papers. However, I have some conflicting ideas around this. Asymptotics are indeed logically useless for applied work, and if one is solely interested in understanding the way the world works with their econometric method, then asymptotics are not necessary. However, I am still learning and trying to understand the role of asymptotics in modern econometrics. This is a topic that I will be exploring in the future."

I then had to make a decision-either graduate with a minor in Mathematics or spend a year abroad in the Netherlands. I chose the latter and do not regret a single thing. I ended up finishing a masters in Economics and Financial Research spec. Econometrics and am now currently a PhD candidate at Maastricht University. The Netherlands has become my home away from home, and I have grown to love living here.\nDuring my time in the Netherlands, I found a passion for statistics and computer science. I learned as much as I could about programming and best practices, as well as how to apply it to my work. This includes:\n\nPrivacy and data rights\nOpen/reproducible science and open source programs\nBest coding practices for social sciences\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, chess, and disc golf. All the photos you will see on this website will be from one of the activities mentioned here."
